LAB - Tekton Fundamentals
=========================

This workshop helps teach the fundamentals of using [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) for CI/CD with Kubernetes. 
As of this time, it will only run on a Kubernetes cluster provisioned by [Tanzu Mission Control (TMC)](https://tanzu.vmware.com/mission-control?gclid=CjwKCAjw-YT1BRAFEiwAd2WRtqC0WthDAKNAPUQzJF0lMXKelEd1gUJhj4UM9wkHHBK-GXlPeIt99hoCZZIQAvD_BwE). The minimum Kubernetes version is v1.15.0 since Tekton itself requires this version.
