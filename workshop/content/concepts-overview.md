Tekton
------

The Tekton project provides Kubernetes resources for declaring continuous integration, continuous 
deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

This workshop discusses concepts around Kubernetes and CI/CD, and you should have a high-level 
understanding about both concepts before proceeding with this workshop.

Kubernetes
----------

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management
of containerized applications.

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
--------------------------------------------------

A continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is an automated expression
of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.
Every change to your software (i.e. committed in source control) goes through a complex
process on its way to being released. This process involves building the software in a
reliable and repeatable manner as well as progressing the built software (called a "build")
through multiple stages of testing and deployment.
