In this self-paced tutorial, you will learn how to use Tekton to automate the deployment of applications 
to Kubernetes.

Here are some of the things you will get to do during this workshop:

* Learn about the [custom resource definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRDs) behind Tekton
* Create a CI/CD pipeline using Tekton CRDs on a Kubernetes cluster via the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) and the Tekton CLI (`tkn`)
* Deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster via a Tekton CI/CD pipeline
* View your deployed application 
* Learn more about the Tekton project as a whole and additional resources for the project
* Explore! You have a Kubernetes cluster with Tekton and associated tools installed. Have fun with it and use it to do things beyond what the workshop suggests when you finish.

All commands in this tutorial can be executed by clicking the running stick figure icon on the side of the command. Go 
ahead and run the following command to see the version of `kubectl`/Kubernetes available during this workshop:

```execute-1 
kubectl version --short
```

Note that there will be times a command is run in the bottom terminal as opposed to the top terminal. For the `tkn` command 
below, when you run it, it will execute in the lower terminal: 

```execute-2 
tkn version
```

Where the command is executed is denoted by the number with the running stick figure icon. If there is a 1, the command will 
execute in the top terminal. If there is a 2, the command will execute in the bottom terminal. 

Before beginning the workshop, execute the following commands to clear your terminals:

```execute-1 
clear
```

```execute-2
clear
```
